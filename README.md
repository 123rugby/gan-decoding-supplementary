![file1](/surrogate_ext_samples_Apr-14-2018_1615.mp4)
This shows a composite video of the trained generator samples conditioned on the surrogate "ext" images (See Fig. 1 for a description of the datasets). This demonstrate the limit of the reconstruction accuracy under our method.

### File: vim-1_val_samples_Apr-14-2018_1615.mp4
This shows a composite video of the trained generator samples conditioned on the denoised vim-1 "val" voxel set corresponding to Fig. 4. This demonstrate the generality of the decoder and the limit of reconstruction accuracy given successful denoising. 

### File: vim-1_test_samples_Apr-14-2018_1615.mp4
This shows a composite video of the trained generator samples conditioned on the fully cross validated vim-1 "test" voxel set corresponding to Fig. 5.
